Hey everyone,

I found the time to make a "Homer Bodyguard costume" and also
on the Google Sketchup 3d Warehouse simply type: "Doberman" for a great Mr Burns Hound-dog
Just thought a Hound chasing you would make a great vehicle.

All Models are in .skp sketchup 16 (2016) format.
These are my final versions of both, please feel free to modify and use
